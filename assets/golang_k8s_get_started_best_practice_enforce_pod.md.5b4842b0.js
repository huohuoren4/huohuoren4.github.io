We recommend taking the time to analyze the types of workloads occurring in each namespace, and by referencing the Pod Security Standards, decide on an appropriate level for each of them. Unlabeled namespaces should only indicate that they&#39;ve yet to be evaluated.</p><p>In the scenario that all workloads in all namespaces have the same security requirements, we provide an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/enforce-standards-namespace-labels/#applying-to-all-namespaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">example</a> that illustrates how the PodSecurity labels can be applied in bulk.</p><h3 id="embrace-the-principle-of-least-privilege" tabindex="-1">Embrace the principle of least privilege <a class="header-anchor" href="#embrace-the-principle-of-least-privilege" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Embrace the principle of least privilege&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In an ideal world, every pod in every namespace would meet the requirements of the <code>restricted</code> policy. However, this is not possible nor practical, as some workloads will require elevated privileges for legitimate reasons.</p><ul><li>Namespaces allowing <code>privileged</code> workloads should establish and enforce appropriate access controls.</li><li>For workloads running in those permissive namespaces, maintain documentation about their unique security requirements. If at all possible, consider how those requirements could be further constrained.</li></ul><h3 id="adopt-a-multi-mode-strategy" tabindex="-1">Adopt a multi-mode strategy <a class="header-anchor" href="#adopt-a-multi-mode-strategy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Adopt a multi-mode strategy&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The <code>audit</code> and <code>warn</code> modes of the Pod Security Standards admission controller make it easy to collect important security insights about your pods without breaking existing workloads.</p><p>It is good practice to enable these modes for all namespaces, setting them to the desired level and version you would eventually like to <code>enforce</code>. The warnings and audit annotations generated in this phase can guide you toward that state. If you expect workload authors to make changes to fit within the desired level, enable the <code>warn</code> mode. If you expect to use audit logs to monitor/drive changes to fit within the desired level, enable the <code>audit</code> mode.</p><p>When you have the <code>enforce</code> mode set to your desired value, these modes can still be useful in a few different ways:</p><ul><li>By setting <code>warn</code> to the same level as <code>enforce</code>, clients will receive warnings when attempting to create Pods (or resources that have Pod templates) that do not pass validation. This will help them update those resources to become compliant.</li><li>In Namespaces that pin <code>enforce</code> to a specific non-latest version, setting the <code>audit</code> and <code>warn</code> modes to the same level as <code>enforce</code>, but to the <code>latest</code> version, gives visibility into settings that were allowed by previous versions but are not allowed per current best practices.</li></ul><h2 id="third-party-alternatives" tabindex="-1">Third-party alternatives <a class="header-anchor" href="#third-party-alternatives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Third-party alternatives&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note:</p><p>This section links to third party projects that provide functionality required by Kubernetes.
