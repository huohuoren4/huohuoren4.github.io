Pods follow a defined lifecycle, starting in the <code>Pending</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">phase</a>, moving through <code>Running</code> if at least one of its primary containers starts OK, and then through either the <code>Succeeded</code> or <code>Failed</code> phases depending on whether any container in the Pod terminated in failure.</p><p>Whilst a Pod is running, the kubelet is able to restart containers to handle some kind of faults. Within a Pod, Kubernetes tracks different container <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#container-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">states</a> and determines what action to take to make the Pod healthy again.</p><p>In the Kubernetes API, Pods have both a specification and an actual status. The status for a Pod object consists of a set of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pod conditions</a>. You can also inject <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-readiness-gate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">custom readiness information</a> into the condition data for a Pod, if that is useful to your application.</p><p>Pods are only <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">scheduled</a> once in their lifetime. Once a Pod is scheduled (assigned) to a Node, the Pod runs on that Node until it stops or is <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">terminated</a>.</p><h2 id="pod-lifetime" tabindex="-1">Pod lifetime <a class="header-anchor" href="#pod-lifetime" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pod lifetime&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Like individual application containers, Pods are considered to be relatively ephemeral (rather than durable) entities. Pods are created, assigned a unique ID (<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UID</a>), and scheduled to nodes where they remain until termination (according to restart policy) or deletion. If a Node dies, the Pods scheduled to that node are <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-garbage-collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">scheduled for deletion</a> after a timeout period.</p><p>Pods do not, by themselves, self-heal. If a Pod is scheduled to a node that then fails, the Pod is deleted; likewise, a Pod won&#39;t survive an eviction due to a lack of resources or Node maintenance. Kubernetes uses a higher-level abstraction, called a controller, that handles the work of managing the relatively disposable Pod instances.</p><p>A given Pod (as defined by a UID) is never &quot;rescheduled&quot; to a different node; instead, that Pod can be replaced by a new, near-identical Pod, with even the same name if desired, but with a different UID.</p><p>When something is said to have the same lifetime as a Pod, such as a volume, that means that the thing exists as long as that specific Pod (with that exact UID) exists. If that Pod is deleted for any reason, and even if an identical replacement is created, the related thing (a volume, in this example) is also destroyed and created anew.</p><p><img src="'+e+`" alt="what-is-a-pod"></p><p>A multi-container Pod that contains a file puller and a web server that uses a persistent volume for shared storage between the containers.</p><h2 id="pod-phase" tabindex="-1">Pod phase <a class="header-anchor" href="#pod-phase" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Pod phase&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A Pod&#39;s <code>status</code> field is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#podstatus-v1-core" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PodStatus</a> object, which has a <code>phase</code> field.</p><p>The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle.

In this case, the readiness probe might be the same as the liveness probe, but the existence of the readiness probe in the spec means that the Pod will start without receiving any traffic and only start receiving traffic after the probe starts succeeding.</p><p>If you want your container to be able to take itself down for maintenance, you can specify a readiness probe that checks an endpoint specific to readiness that is different from the liveness probe.</p><p>If your app has a strict dependency on back-end services, you can implement both a liveness and a readiness probe. The liveness probe passes when the app itself is healthy, but the readiness probe additionally checks that each required back-end service is available. This helps you avoid directing traffic to Pods that can only respond with error messages.</p><p>If your container needs to work on loading large data, configuration files, or migrations during startup, you can use a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#when-should-you-use-a-startup-probe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">startup probe</a>.

The Pod remains in the unready state while it waits for the containers in the Pod to stop.</p></div><h4 id="when-should-you-use-a-startup-probe" tabindex="-1">When should you use a startup probe? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-should-you-use-a-startup-probe" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When should you use a startup probe?&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Startup probes are useful for Pods that have containers that take a long time to come into service. Rather than set a long liveness interval, you can configure a separate configuration for probing the container as it starts up, allowing a time longer than the liveness interval would allow.</p><p>If your container usually starts in more than <code>initialDelaySeconds + failureThreshold × periodSeconds</code>, you should specify a startup probe that checks the same endpoint as the liveness probe. The default for <code>periodSeconds</code> is 10s. You should then set its <code>failureThreshold</code> high enough to allow the container to start, without changing the default values of the liveness probe. This helps to protect against deadlocks.</p><h2 id="termination-of-pods" tabindex="-1">Termination of Pods <a class="header-anchor" href="#termination-of-pods" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Termination of Pods&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Because Pods represent processes running on nodes in the cluster, it is important to allow those processes to gracefully terminate when they are no longer needed (rather than being abruptly stopped with a <code>KILL</code> signal and having no chance to clean up).</p><p>The design aim is for you to be able to request deletion and know when processes terminate, but also be able to ensure that deletes eventually complete. When you request deletion of a Pod, the cluster records and tracks the intended grace period before the Pod is allowed to be forcefully killed. With that forceful shutdown tracking in place, the kubelet attempts graceful shutdown.</p><p>Typically, with this graceful termination of the pod, kubelet makes requests to the container runtime to attempt to stop the containers in the pod by first sending a TERM (aka. SIGTERM) signal, with a grace period timeout, to the main process in each container. The requests to stop the containers are processed by the container runtime asynchronously. There is no guarantee to the order of processing for these requests. Many container runtimes respect the <code>STOPSIGNAL</code> value defined in the container image and, if different, send the container image configured STOPSIGNAL instead of TERM. Once the grace period has expired, the KILL signal is sent to any remaining processes, and the Pod is then deleted from the API Server. If the kubelet or the container runtime&#39;s management service is restarted while waiting for processes to terminate, the cluster retries from the start including the full original grace period.</p><p>An example flow:</p><ol><li><p>You use the <code>kubectl</code> tool to manually delete a specific Pod, with the default grace period (30 seconds).</p></li><li><p>The Pod in the API server is updated with the time beyond which the Pod is considered &quot;dead&quot; along with the grace period. If you use <code>kubectl describe</code> to check the Pod you&#39;re deleting, that Pod shows up as &quot;Terminating&quot;. On the node where the Pod is running: as soon as the kubelet sees that a Pod has been marked as terminating (a graceful shutdown duration has been set), the kubelet begins the local Pod shutdown process.</p><ul><li><p>If one of the Pod&#39;s containers has defined a <code>preStop</code> <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">hook</a> and the <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code> in the Pod spec is not set to 0, the kubelet runs that hook inside of the container. The default <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code> setting is 30 seconds.</p><p>If the <code>preStop</code> hook is still running after the grace period expires, the kubelet requests a small, one-off grace period extension of 2 seconds.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note:</p><p>If the <code>preStop</code> hook needs longer to complete than the default grace period allows, you must modify <code>terminationGracePeriodSeconds</code> to suit this.</p></div></li><li><p>The kubelet triggers the container runtime to send a TERM signal to process 1 inside each container.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note:</p><p>The containers in the Pod receive the TERM signal at different times and in an arbitrary order. If the order of shutdowns matters, consider using a <code>preStop</code> hook to synchronize.</p></div></li></ul></li><li><p>At the same time as the kubelet is starting graceful shutdown of the Pod, the control plane evaluates whether to remove that shutting-down Pod from EndpointSlice (and Endpoints) objects, where those objects represent a Service with a configured selector. ReplicaSets and other workload resources no longer treat the shutting-down Pod as a valid, in-service replica.</p><p>Pods that shut down slowly should not continue to serve regular traffic and should start terminating and finish processing open connections. Some applications need to go beyond finishing open connections and need more graceful termination, for example, session draining and completion.</p><p>Any endpoints that represent the terminating Pods are not immediately removed from EndpointSlices, and a status indicating <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/#conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">terminating state</a> is exposed from the EndpointSlice API (and the legacy Endpoints API). Terminating endpoints always have their <code>ready</code> status as <code>false</code> (for backward compatibility with versions before 1.26), so load balancers will not use it for regular traffic.</p><p>If traffic draining on terminating Pod is needed, the actual readiness can be checked as a condition <code>serving</code>. You can find more details on how to implement connections draining in the tutorial <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/services/pods-and-endpoint-termination-flow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pods And Endpoints Termination Flow</a></p></li></ol><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note:</p><p>If you don&#39;t have the <code>EndpointSliceTerminatingCondition</code> feature gate enabled in your cluster (the gate is on by default from Kubernetes 1.22, and locked to default in 1.26), then the Kubernetes control plane removes a Pod from any relevant EndpointSlices as soon as the Pod&#39;s termination grace period begins.
