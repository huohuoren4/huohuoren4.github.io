Go back and review the tutorial and compare your code with the steps you took to get there. Compare your project to the <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/main/examples/tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">example project</a>, which might look a bit different due to the step-by-step nature of the tutorial.</p><p>There’s a lot more to Flask than what you’ve seen so far. Even so, you’re now equipped to start developing your own web applications. Check out the <a href="/python/flask/user_guide/quickstart#quickstart">Quickstart</a> for an overview of what Flask can do, then dive into the docs to keep learning. Flask uses <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Jinja</a>, <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Click</a>, <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Werkzeug</a>, and <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/itsdangerous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ItsDangerous</a> behind the scenes, and they all have their own documentation too. You’ll also be interested in <a href="/python/flask/user_guide/extension#extensions">Extensions</a> which make tasks like working with the database or validating form data easier and more powerful.</p><p>If you want to keep developing your Flaskr project, here are some ideas for what to try next:</p><ul><li><p>A detail view to show a single post.
